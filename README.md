This project is an effort towards developing insightful visualization that is targeted for audiences such as F1 Team owners, Sponsors, F1 Drivers. The dashboards will help team owners in selecting drivers based on past performances, it will help drivers track their past performances and draft strategies to improve their performance in the upcoming seasons. As for the audiences, they can pick their hero for the race based on the visualizations that present the odds of drivers on a circuit. 
Audience: F1 Team Owners, F1 Drivers, F1 global audience and sponsors.
Context: With the onset of 2017, The first Grand Prix is set to begin on 26th of March in Melbourne â€“ Australia followed by 19 such championships being held worldwide this season. The team owners, need to compete for top driver and top Teams to represent them in the championships. For drivers, to be chosen and make a legendary F1 career, need a well drafted strategy to ace the following championships, and hence need to get a visual on their past record of accomplishments. As for sponsors, using the championship as a global media platform could build their brands and benefit their business.
Story: Our aim is to present information about major aspects of F1 racing such as Top Drivers, Top Teams, Top Circuits etc. We first present information that covers the entire 60 years of Formula 1 racing, as our presentation goes further and insights become detailed we have reduced the number of years that we consider. Towards the end of our visualization we have presented an interactive way of comparing two drivers in a single frame, this is based on the points that the driver has collected in his career. We are using a funnel approach in our story boarding.
